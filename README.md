This repo contains my personal take on year 2022's AoC coding challenges, written in Rust.
It's quickly become my new favorite language, toppling Go as the no. 1 contender.

- Keep the christmas spirit alive;
- Get familiar with as many aspects of Rust programming as I can (e.g.: the typesystem and its possibilities).
